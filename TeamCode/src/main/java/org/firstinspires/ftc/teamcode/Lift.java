    // arms upright for most of match

    // so we give options to control the arm, which would be called when lift mode is activated,
    // done by pressing b
    // while a for controlling delivery arm
    // another button for intake?
    // then each have methods for activate/deactivate, just moving from resting to active position
    // called when switching via a/b, but in the classes providing those methods, the use of the
    // methods isn't specified

    // when intake is active, when we switch to drop arm, it puts pixel in that?
    // or there's just a button for that?
    // design it so that as soon as it has the pixel, the driver's intended to switch to the
    // scoring arm, so that it gets into position asap, and while poodledoodledaisy arm is selected,
    // scoring arm is in position to receive pixel and get into position asap
    // how to select between two methods of picking up and delivering pixel?
    // select one when selecting poodledoodledaisy arm, then just a single button for intake arm,
    // which is selected automatically

    // name it scoring arm or bucket arm? assuming it does both methods of delivery
    // poodledoodledaisy arm to be named poodledoodledaisy arm for historical reasons
